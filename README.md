Fireblog is a minimal, clean, blogging solution powered by [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Realtime Database and [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org). Among the features are:

 - A full Markdown Editor powered by [Woofmark](https://bevacqua.github.io/woofmark/)
 - Multiple User Registration & Authentication
 - A commenting system
 - Unique, persistent Post and Profile URLs
 - Profile and Post changes updated in realtime without page reloads
 - Content caching using HTML5 LocalStorage

Plus other things that are either already implemented, or in the pipeline. This is an alpha release, so expect bugs.
